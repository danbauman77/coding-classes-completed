Univ. housing benefits for non-president administrators
===================================
Amid university-wide budget cuts, the college purchased a new house for the provost. Webster spokesman Patrick Giblin said Provost Julian Schuster is provided housing under his contract with the university. The university purchased 8376 Big Bend in September 2012 for $385,000. Using Tableau Desktop, I created a searchable database for readers of the housing benefits for non-president administrators at 100 universities and colleges. 

This choice of private colleges and universities for this analysis is based off pay data from 2010 for college presidents compiled by the Chronicle of Higher Education. Because college presidents are typically the highest-paid employees at an institution, The Journal felt their pay would indicate the pay structure for the institution. President Elizabeth Stroble was the 184th highest-paid president out of 494 chief executives. The Journal examined the housing benefits for the institutions of the next 50 highest-paid presidents and the prior 50 highest-paid presidents.
